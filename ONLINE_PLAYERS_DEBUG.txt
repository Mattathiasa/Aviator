STEPS TO DEBUG:
===============

1. RESTART THE SERVER
   - Stop the server if running (Ctrl+C)
   - Run: npm run server
   - Look for: "🎮 Aviator Server running on port 3001"

2. OPEN THE GAME
   Choose one of these routes:

   - OR go to: http://localhost:5173/multiplayer (Classic Design)
   - Enter your name when prompted
   - Click "Start Playing" or "Set"

3. CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE (F12)
   Look for these messages:
   - "Connected to server" ✓
   - "📥 Received online players update: [...]" ✓
   - "🔍 Online Players State: [...]" (on /aviator) ✓
   - "🔍 [Multiplayer] Online Players State: [...]" (on /multiplayer) ✓

6. TEST WITH MULTIPLE PLAYERS
   - Open another browser tab/window
